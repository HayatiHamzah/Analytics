## Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is the problem of identifying data points that don't conform to expected (normal) behaviour. Unexpected data points are also known as outliers and exceptions etc. Anomaly detection has crucial significance in the wide variety of domains as it provides critical and actionable information. For example, an anomaly in MRI image scan could be an indication of the malignant tumor or anomalous reading from production plant sensor may indicate faulty component. There are various statistical methods to do it such as [Gaussian distribution](https://github.com/HayatiHamzah/Analytics/blob/master/Anomaly%20Detection/Gaussian%20Distribution.ipynb) and [One-class SVM](https://github.com/HayatiHamzah/Analytics/blob/master/Anomaly%20Detection/One-Class%20SVM.ipynb).
